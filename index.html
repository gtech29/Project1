        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>With the growing presence of generative technologies in education and the workplace, future educators need to
          be ready
          not only to utilize them, but also to critically evaluate their drawbacks, their assumptions and ethical
          implications.

          This project examines how teachers and students can use interview simulators, which utilize large language
          models, both
          as a part of teacher education coursework and view students as active participants in technological use.</p>

        <h2 id="project-content-title" class="visually-hidden">Why This Project</h2>
        <p>As digital tools become more common in schools and workplaces, future educators will encounter technology not
          only as
          teachers, but as professionals being evaluated, interviewed, and supported by automated systems. Many
          students, however,
          have limited opportunities to explore how these tools work or to reflect on their strengths and limitations.

          This project creates a space for students to practice interviewing while also stepping back to consider how
          technology
          shapes communication, decision-making, and fairness in education.</p>

        <h2 id="project-outcomes-title">What the Interview Simulator Does</h2>
        <p>The interview simulator presents students with common interview questions they might encounter as future
          teachers. These
          include questions about classroom management, teaching philosophy, and working with diverse learners.

          Students respond as they would in a real interview. The simulator then continues the conversation, allowing
          students to
          reflect on the tone, phrasing, and assumptions behind the questions and responses.

          The goal is not to score students or judge their performance, but to give them a realistic scenario they can
          learn from..</p>

        <h2 id="project-conclusion-title">How Students Use It</h2>
        <p>Students engage with the simulator as part of their coursework through a simple, guided process:

          Participate in a simulated teaching interview

          Review the questions and feedback they received

          Reflect on what felt helpful, unclear, or unrealistic

          Discuss how technology compares to human feedback in interview settings

          These activities help students slow down and think critically about their experience, rather than focusing
          only on
          “getting the right answer.”</p>
