# Project 1 — Personal Interest Website (HTML + CSS)

A personal web site about my favorite band **The Doors,** written in semantic HTML and custom-written
CSS (no libraries, no CSS frameworks, no code generators).

Created for **COMP 484 — Web Engineering I**.

## Overview

The project is intended to show familiarity in fundamental
concepts of HTML structure; I achieved this through formatting my project using
clean readable formatting and commenting. I also applied only one styling sheet
to achieve uniform design.
